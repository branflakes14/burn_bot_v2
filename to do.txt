- implement play/draw config

- improve burn logic (some 1cmc spells still have priority over 2cmc spells when we have 2 mana,
maybe in the ==2 mana if statement check to see if there's two 1cmc spells to play) maybe do it
this way:
if 3 mana, cast a 1cmc spell, THEN check for 2x 1cmc spells in hand, if so cast them,
if not cast a 2cmc spell

example of it going wrong (it should've cast the helix to spend mana properly):
Turn: 3
Hand after draw step: ['Lightning_Bolt', 'Lightning_Helix', 'Fetchland', 'Fetchland', 'Goblin_Guide']
Mana for turn: 3
Battlefield precombat: ['Monastery_Swiftspear', 'Eidolon', 'Goblin_Guide']
Cast this turn: ['Goblin_Guide', 'Lightning_Bolt']
Damage dealt by EOT: 15

- change rift bolt logic, needs to be if total hand cmc is castable, cast everything including
hard cast rift bolt. atm will only hardcast rift bolt if it's the only nonland

- BIG CHANGE? instead of deciding what to play from zones.hand, have
zones.options to allow for mode/activated abilities to be added when cards
are put in the respective zone? for example, resolving a grim lavamancer would add
its ability to zones.options. skewer would be awkward to check. maybe
sum(

- make v3 logic that ACTUALLY WORKS
